    <p>
    Welcome, I have transfered my CV from a word document into a website made using HTML 5. 
    I’m a highly passionate and energetic person who enjoys learning new skills and meeting new people. 
    I have been working for a few years in different roles and have built up a wide set of skills to help me in multiple sectors. 
    I’m now looking for a new career where I can continue to develop my skills and passion for my career.
    Currently I work as a self employed plumber but I've taken a step back from this to develop other skills and try and find something new for myself that's more suited.

        <h2><u>Work Experience</u></h2>
        <br/>

            <h3><u>Freelance Plumber & Bathroom Design - (2020-Present)</u></h3>

                <p> 
                    For the last few years I have trained in, and later began installing and designing bathrooms as a sole trader in residential properties. 
                    My time is mostly split between actual plumbing and building work whilst also being involved with the customer throughout the whole
                    process so that they are kept in the loop and we can both go through timescales and any questions they have through the process.
                    While i found great value in doing this, collecting many skils I never had before, I don't believe the industry is suited for me.
                </p>

            <h3><u>Bathroom Solutions - (2018-2020)</u></h3>
                <p>
                    <h4><u>Delivery Driver & Warehouse Manager</u></h4>
                    After recruitment I got work as a Delivery Driver for a small company in my local area. 
                    I was in charge of making sure all jobs have been ordered and are stored correctly before being loaded onto vehicles in perfect condition whilst keeping on top of paperwork. 
                    I also have a large amount customer exposure both in the shop as well as out of delivery. 
                </p>
            
            <h3><u>Projeq Recruitment - (2017-2018)</u></h3>
                <p>
                    <h4><u>Recruitment Resourcer</u></h4> 
                    For just under a year and a half I worked for a recruitment company specialising in the recruitment of white collar engineering (Quality Engineers, Production Managers, Mechanical Design Engineer etc.). 
                    My role involved the finding of candidates for specific roles given to me by the consultant. 
                    Once I find suitable candidates I then had to interview them and make sure that they are right for the job. 
                    Some of my other duties included the finding of jobs advertised by companies and add them to the system. 
                    Once they have been added I then find suitable CV’s to be send to the company so that the consultant can follow up and try and get more roles out of the company.
                    On occasion I traveled down to meet prospective clients so that we could better understand the nature of their business and what kind of environment that the candidates we source would be working in. 
                    This has helped me to develop myself in a professional manor and how I should conduct myself in a professional environment.
                </p>

            <h3><u>Convergys Calls - (2016-2017)</u></h3>
                <p>
                    <h4><u>Customer Service Advisor</u></h4>
                    Previously I worked in a Convergys call centre. 
                    The nature of this work means I am constantly calling customers which leaves me very busy whilst working and I have learnt to be extremely productive and capable under the demanding pressure of a heavy work load while still managing to keep to the high standards that are expected. 
                    I deal with lots of different people every day and always ensure the best possible customer service and has helped me to be flexible in the numerous situations that I face day to day.
                </p>

            <h3><u>McDonalds (Fast Food Chain) - (2013-2016)</u></h3>
                <p>
                    <h4><u>Crew Member</u></h4>
                    Before Convergys I worked in a McDonalds restaurant as a Crew Member whilst in college and continued after graduating. 
                    With my working during busy periods of the day at a constant fast pace this was the starting point to which I built my ability to work under pressure and work in a large team to achieve goals and give polite and professional customer service. 
                    From the cooking of food to cleaning of all the equipment used throughout the day I remained profession and quick.
                    During my time there I also worked a large amount in the stock room. During this time, I was expected to collect the right stock that was need by the restaurant downstairs and transport it from the stock room to the storage in the kitchen. 
                    This involved me having to lift large amounts of boxes containing dried and frozen foods that came in large quantities and some items were a lot heavier than others. 
                    I had to remain safe and professional the whole time to avoid injury to myself and those around me. 
                    I was also required to work overnights and early mornings to take in stock from deliveries and store is in the correct place safely and efficiently. 
                    I was required to work in a large industrial freezer/fridge and move stock around to fit it in and make sure that the freshest stock was as the back so that we could use what was closer to the use by date in order not to waste food.
                </p>
            
            <h3><u>Manchester City Football Club (2014-2015)</u></h3>
                <p>
                    <h4><u>Event Steward</u></h4>
                    During my time working at McDonalds I also took a part time job working at Manchester City Stadium as a steward. 
                    This role involved managing the personal safety and wellbeing of people attending games and numerous concerts. 
                    This involved a significant amount of customer interaction where I must be polite, 
                    informative and professional whilst at the same time be aware of any potential security risk that may impact the enjoyment for the majority of supporters.
